                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>The United States has obtained new intelligence indicating that Israel is making preparations for a potential strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the Trump administration continues to pursue diplomatic negotiations with Tehran.</p>
                    
                    <p>According to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence, Israel has been conducting extensive military exercises and has positioned certain military assets in preparation for a possible operation. The intelligence suggests that these preparations have intensified in recent weeks, coinciding with Iran's continued nuclear activities.</p>
                    
                    <p>The situation presents a complex diplomatic challenge for the United States, which is currently engaged in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. The Trump administration has been working to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the US withdrew in 2018.</p>
                    
                    <p>Israeli officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program, particularly regarding the country's uranium enrichment activities. They argue that Iran is moving closer to developing nuclear weapons capability, despite Tehran's claims that its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new intelligence has prompted urgent discussions among US national security officials and their Israeli counterparts. The Biden administration has emphasized its commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons while preferring a diplomatic solution to the current impasse.</p>
                    
                    <p>Regional experts warn that any military action against Iranian nuclear facilities could have far-reaching consequences, potentially triggering a broader conflict in the Middle East. Iran has previously threatened to respond to any attack on its nuclear facilities with military force.</p>
                    
                    <p>The situation is further complicated by ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, which have been engaged in a shadow war across the Middle East for years. Recent incidents, including attacks on Israeli shipping and Iranian nuclear facilities, have heightened concerns about potential escalation.</p>
                    
                    <p>International observers are closely monitoring the situation, with many calling for renewed diplomatic efforts to prevent any military confrontation. The United Nations has urged all parties to exercise restraint and return to the negotiating table.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the situation continues to develop, the international community remains divided on the best approach to address Iran's nuclear program, with some advocating for stronger diplomatic engagement and others supporting a more confrontational stance.</p>
