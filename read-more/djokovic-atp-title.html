                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>In a historic moment for tennis, Novak Djokovic joined an elite club of players by winning his 100th ATP singles title at the Geneva Open. The Serbian superstar achieved this remarkable feat by defeating Hubert Hurkacz in a thrilling three-set final, with the scoreline reading 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2).</p>
                    
                    <p>Djokovic now joins Jimmy Connors (109 titles) and Roger Federer (103 titles) as the only men in the Open era to reach the century mark in ATP singles titles. This milestone further cements his place among the greatest players in tennis history.</p>
                    
                    <p>"It's a very special moment for me," said Djokovic after the match. "To reach 100 titles is something I never dreamed of when I started playing tennis. It's a testament to the hard work, dedication, and support from my team and family throughout my career."</p>
                    
                    <p>The match itself was a rollercoaster of emotions, with both players showcasing their exceptional skills. Hurkacz, known for his powerful serve and aggressive play, pushed Djokovic to his limits. The first set went to the Polish player, but Djokovic's experience and mental toughness shone through in the crucial moments.</p>
                    
                    <p>The second and third sets both went to tiebreaks, where Djokovic's superior tiebreak record proved decisive. His ability to raise his game in pressure situations was evident as he dominated both tiebreaks with a score of 7-2.</p>
                    
                    <p>This victory comes at a crucial time for Djokovic, who has been working to regain his form after a challenging start to the season. The win in Geneva will give him much-needed confidence heading into the French Open, where he will be looking to add to his Grand Slam collection.</p>
                    
                    <p>"This is a great boost for my confidence," Djokovic added. "I've been working hard on my game, and it's nice to see the results paying off. The French Open is just around the corner, and I'm feeling good about my chances."</p>
                    
                    <p>The achievement is particularly impressive considering the level of competition in modern tennis and the physical demands of the sport. Djokovic's longevity and consistency at the highest level have been key factors in reaching this milestone.</p>
