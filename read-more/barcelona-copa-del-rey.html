                    <p>Barcelona secured a dramatic victory in the Copa del Rey final against their arch-rivals Real Madrid, with Ferran Torres playing a pivotal role in the triumph. The match, which was played at the iconic Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium, ended 3-2 in favor of the Catalan giants.</p>
                    
                    <p>"This was such a physically demanding game, but we showed that we are a great team that never gives up," said Torres, who filled in perfectly for the injured Robert Lewandowski. The Spanish forward scored two crucial goals and provided an assist in what was undoubtedly his best performance in a Barcelona shirt.</p>
                    
                    <p>The match started with high intensity as both teams looked to establish dominance early. Real Madrid took the lead in the 15th minute through Vin√≠cius J√∫nior, but Barcelona responded quickly with Torres equalizing just five minutes later. The first half ended 1-1, setting up a thrilling second half.</p>
                    
                    <p>After the break, Barcelona came out stronger and took the lead through Torres' second goal in the 55th minute. However, Real Madrid equalized through Jude Bellingham in the 70th minute, setting up a tense final 20 minutes. The decisive moment came in the 85th minute when Torres set up substitute Ansu Fati for the winning goal.</p>
                    
                    <p>Barcelona's victory marks their 31st Copa del Rey title, extending their record as the most successful team in the competition's history. The win also provides a much-needed boost for the team after a challenging season in La Liga.</p>
                    
                    <p>Manager Xavi Hern√°ndez praised his team's character and resilience: "This victory shows the true spirit of Barcelona. We never gave up, even when things were difficult. The players showed incredible determination and quality."</p>
                    
                    <p>The celebrations continued long into the night as thousands of Barcelona fans gathered in the city center to celebrate their team's triumph. The players will now turn their attention to their remaining La Liga fixtures, where they are still in contention for a top-four finish.</p>
