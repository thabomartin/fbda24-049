                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>In a surprising turn of events, Japan's agriculture minister Taku Eto has resigned from his position after making what he thought was a lighthearted comment about rice gifts from his supporters. The incident has sparked a national conversation about political ethics and gift-giving in Japanese politics.</p>
                    
                    <p>The controversy began during a press conference when Minister Eto, responding to a question about rising rice prices, joked that he "never had to buy rice" because his supporters regularly give him "plenty" of it as gifts. The comment, intended to be humorous, quickly backfired as it was interpreted as a display of political privilege and insensitivity to the economic struggles of ordinary citizens.</p>
                    
                    <p>Japanese law has strict regulations regarding gifts to public officials, with a limit of 5,000 yen (approximately $45) per gift. The minister's casual admission of receiving regular rice gifts raised concerns about potential violations of these regulations and ethical standards.</p>
                    
                    <p>The public reaction was swift and severe, with social media platforms flooded with criticism. Many citizens expressed outrage at what they perceived as a tone-deaf comment from a high-ranking official during a time of economic uncertainty and rising food prices.</p>
                    
                    <p>Opposition parties quickly seized on the incident, calling for Eto's resignation and launching an investigation into the gift-giving practices. The ruling party, facing mounting pressure, initially defended the minister but eventually accepted his resignation as the controversy continued to grow.</p>
                    
                    <p>In his resignation statement, Eto expressed regret for his comments and acknowledged that they were inappropriate. "I deeply apologize for my careless remarks that caused public concern," he said. "I take full responsibility for my actions and hope that my resignation will help restore public trust in the government."</p>
                    
                    <p>The incident has prompted a broader discussion about gift-giving culture in Japanese politics and the need for greater transparency in political donations and gifts. The government has announced plans to review and strengthen its guidelines regarding gifts to public officials.</p>
                    
                    <p>Political analysts note that this incident highlights the increasing scrutiny of public officials' behavior in Japan, where social media and public opinion can quickly turn minor incidents into major political crises. The case also underscores the importance of sensitivity to public concerns, particularly regarding economic issues that directly affect citizens' daily lives.</p>
